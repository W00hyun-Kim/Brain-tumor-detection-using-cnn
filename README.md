# Brain tumor classification using Convolutional Neural Network

For this project, I am using a 2D Convolutional Neural Network with `nine` hidden layers to classify 2D MRI brain scan images as tumorous or non-tumorous. Model was built with Tensorflow, utilizing the Keras API. Model's input is composed of standardized 240x240x1 single-channel image arrays. After training, an image passed to the model will produce a prediction of either 1 (tumorous) or 0 (non-tumorous).
